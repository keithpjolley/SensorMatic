A wifi dingle to report temperature, humidity, light, and IR sensor status.

Compiled with Arduino 1.0.5 on OS X 10.8.4 http://arduino.cc/en/Main/Software

BOM:

- From http://www.adafruit.com/
  - 1 x AM2302 (wired DHT22)  temperature-humidity sensor [ID:393]  https://www.adafruit.com/products/393
  - 1 x Photo cell (CdS photoresistor) [ID:161] https://www.adafruit.com/products/161
  - 1 x IR distance sensor includes cable (10cm-80cm) (GP2Y0A21YK0F) [ID:164] https://www.adafruit.com/products/164

- From http://www.yourduino.com/
  - 1 x arduino mega 2560  http://yourduino.com/sunshop2/index.php?l=product\_detail&p=7

- From http://www.cutedigi.com/
  - 1 x CuHead WiFi Shield for Arduino Mega  http://www.cutedigi.com/arduino-shields/cuhead-wifi-shield-for-arduino-mega.html

- And:
  - 1 x LED (too bright may be annoying)
  - 1 x 330 ohm resistor (somewhere between 200 and 1000)
  - 1 x 10k ohm resistor
  - 1 x small project box
  - 1 x 5V power supply

Note that even though YourDuino is in Hong Kong and I am in California, I got the parts delivered
several days earlier (via DHS) than the parts I ordered on the same day from Colorado (via USPS).
The only downside is the enclosed documentation is all in Chinese - though it's pretty simple to
find English docs online if needed.
